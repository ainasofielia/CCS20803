        <p class="pt-3 text-start">Nearly fifty years after its conception in 1971, Nikes iconic Swoosh logo remains unchanged, 
		showcasing a prevalent and pioneering symbol for the brand. Perhaps the most sought-after sneaker of all time, 
		the Nike Mag from Back to the Future Part II was released in 2011 via limited eBay auctions to support the Michael J. Fox Foundation. 
		The pair feature a round toe, a flat rubber sole, a signature Nike swoosh, a mid-calf length, a branded ankle strap and light-up detailing.</p>

          <p class="pt-3 text-start">Like the “On the Turf” tagline repeated on the tongue label and heel, 
		  the Nike SB Dunk Low Born X Raised represents an on-the-ground and “One Block at a Time,” perspective, bringing the typography, colors, 
		  and personality of LA street culture into every aspect of the design. Starting with the citys colors, 
		  the Dunk Low Born X Raised adds pops of pink and custom artwork inspired by bandana patterns and the brands signature typography that 
		  told LAs story throughout the 80s and 90s. Mirroring the duality of city culture itself, the upper features full-grain leather construction 
		  and a mix of contrasting details, from the lenticular Swoosh and heel tabs, perforated toe and upper eyelets, embroidered artwork, 
		  and sock liner graphic of the iconic Venice pavillion. From the bold brand messaging to subtle details such as the heat-printed “In Loving Memory” 
		  dedication on the laces, the Born X Raised Dunk commemorates its commitment and devotion to preserving the past and pushing the future.</p>

          <p class="pt-3 text-start">The Nike Air Yeezy 2 Red October was created in collaboration with musician and fashion designer, Kanye West. 
		  The Air Yeezy 2 Red October features a distinctive design that includes a molded upper with a reptilian texture. The midsole is composed of Phylon foam, 
		  which is lightweight and flexible, providing cushioning for the foot. The Air-Sole unit is in the heel and is visible through a window in the sole, 
		  and provides additional cushioning and support. A strap at the front of the shoe helps to secure the foot in place, 
		  while the rubber outsole provides traction on a variety of surfaces.The outsole of the Nike Air Yeezy 2 Red October is made of a durable rubber material 
		  with a unique pattern that provides excellent traction on a variety of surfaces. We think that the most notable feature of the shoe is the striking 
		  red colorway. The bright red hue is bold and eye-catching, making the sneakers stand out. The shoe was released on February 9th, 2014, 
		  at a retail price of $250.</p>
